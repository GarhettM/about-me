            <p>I landed in the states with my family in 2005. I was 12 years old, had traversed 2 continents, 3 countries, 5 cities, 7 schools, and spoke 3 languages. Graduted High School at the age of 17 with a lot of strange things happening around me. I went straight into summer quarter at Bellevue College and I quickly realized that everything I was learning was "googleable" and lost interest in paying out of pocket AND supporting myself with a full-time job. So I decided to try to learn more about myself and how I need to operate, see more of the world. I saw some of the world, hopped from management position to management position in sales and became more interested in administration particularly in the technology field. I saved up for a couple years and started my own small business on Amazon but it\'s barely enough to pay the bills... so despite single-highhandedly funding and starting my own business at 25, I feel like I basically bought myself a job. It has been a arduous, yet enriching experience and after two long years, I\'m in the just barely in the green, but technically speaking, that\'s a small success! So I fell in love with Amazon\'s Seller Central platform and the company\'s now-global scope for eCommerce. After my own business jolted alive on Amazon, I felt like all that effort and careful planning had finally bore fruit! it was a tremendous moment for my morale and felt great, I suddenly realized that I wanted other people to feel that "cha-ching moment" ... imagine if the whole world connected by a centralized FREE trade network, shipping would be secure and faster than ever, accuracy of sales and user data.... I\'ve got some wild ideas brewing but I need learn how to express them in a technical environment. I looked at every avenue to get into Amazon but my experience alone was not enough to get me an interview but I got inspiring feedback saying that I need a tangible tech skill to tether my experience to. After doing some research and talking to some people in the industry, I found that Code Fellows is an aggressive but highly acclaimed program that\'s entirely focused on blazing the trail to create an effective alternative path to a career in the software industry! I got saw an ad for the info night at Coding U in Bellevue and I decided this could be it.... after nearly 10 years of "spinning my wheels", I\'ve encountered an education path with a worthy ROI! I\'ve learned not to get too excited and take life day by day.... and now it looks to be that I\'m taking the CodeFellows way!'</p>
